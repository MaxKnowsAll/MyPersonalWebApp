                    <h3> H my name is max, I am a really chill dude who loves to play video games and hangout with friends. I love to snowboard and I teach little children how to do the same. Teaching is something I'm proud of, it's something thats not easy since little children are demons but its a lot of fun! I love the cold when it comes to snowboard anything outside of that I hate it but summer is beautiful. I love to go on runs in the morning and sometimes if I get out early enough I can see the sunrise which is mesmerising. Another fact about me is that I love to play soccer I used to play rep soccer until covid hit and I haven't really put any effort into the sport but in the near future I would love to try again. What I see myself doing in the future can be many things but I would love to code, not sure exactly where and what type but creating someting with my own creativity seams like a lot of fun! I enjoy cooking and if I can acumliate a decent amount of money I would love to own a personal Restaurant. </h3>

                        <h5>Website</h5> 
                        <p>My second project I worked on was a website that I had to design for my coop. I was tasked to design a website for a eletrical charging company. This took a long time and the process was very difficult. Luckily I didn't code it because I would of been there for years. I was able to use wordpress and design a template throught there and I would have to say I was proud of the work. I got a lot of cool aniimations inside of it and the boss liked it and gave me a bonus for it.</p>

                        <h4>Arduino Traffic Light</h4> 
                        <p>My first ever tech project would be a traffic stop light. I worked with maheen to create a traffic light, we make it turn green, yellow and red. It was a lot of fun and really enjoyable. I was able to gain skills on coding with an arduino and thats I can tell you isn't fun. What was fun about it was putting all the wires around and figuring on the breadboard what to do. In the end of the project we came up with the design to create a phone lock box and the code for that was horendous.</p>

                        <h5>Gui App</h5> 
                        <p>X games this game was our Gui project and who i mean by our was me and leo lao (the goat)! We created a game just like the impossible game but a lot simpler! Me and leo came up with the idea after I saw a video and I was like boom. We ended up created this game with 4 questions each had a little twist to them which had questions that you had to solve but you would have to think outside the box to figure it out. We had a lot of ups and downs our biggest problem was finally getting our first question to work which was getting x to be the answer in other words closing app would get you to the next question. Once we were finally able to finish our game we were so happy that it actually pieced together. Our stretch goals were mostly meet other than the fact that we wanted a website version. This game could and will be the next big thing. We want to make it a website make it have ui and ux design features. We want to a make it 100 questions make it unbeatable, the hardest game of them all.</p>

                        <p>Were cooked, the app to use when your cooked. This app was made to help anyone in need for any recipe you can think of. Whatever you had in your fridge you would then add to a list and then out would come a bunch recipes that you would love!!! Me and Maheen really cooked with this website and we definitely had our ups and downs our biggest setback was definitely the conversion of connecting both javascript and html but our biggest goal was accomplishing the fact we got 100 plus recipes into our website. This app has a future and during uni I will definitely do something to it. As it says we would like to add a social media presence letting people add their own ideas and also use machine learning to this.
