                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <h3> H my name is max, I am a really chill dude who loves to play video games and hangout with friends. I love to snowboard and I teach little children how to do the same. Teaching is something I'm proud of, it's something thats not easy since little children are demons but its a lot of fun! I love the cold when it comes to snowboard anything outside of that I hate it but summer is beautiful. I love to go on runs in the morning and sometimes if I get out early enough I can see the sunrise which is mesmerising. Another fact about me is that I love to play soccer I used to play rep soccer until covid hit and I haven't really put any effort into the sport but in the near future I would love to try again. What I see myself doing in the future can be many things but I would love to code, not sure exactly where and what type but creating someting with my own creativity seams like a lot of fun! I enjoy cooking and if I can acumliate a decent amount of money I would love to own a personal Restaurant. </h3>

                       <h5>Website</h5> 
                       <p>My second project I worked on was a website that I had to design for my coop. I was tasked to design a website for a eletrical charging company. This took a long time and the process was very difficult. Luckily I didn't code it because I would of been there for years. I was able to use wordpress and design a template throught there and I would have to say I was proud of the work. I got a lot of cool aniimations inside of it and the boss liked it and gave me a bonus for it.</p>

                           <h4>Arduino Traffic Light</h4> 
                           <p>My first ever tech project would be a traffic stop light. I worked with maheen to create a traffic light, we make it turn green, yellow and red. It was a lot of fun and really enjoyable. I was able to gain skills on coding with an arduino and thats I can tell you isn't fun. What was fun about it was putting all the wires around and figuring on the breadboard what to do. In the end of the project we came up with the design to create a phone lock box and the code for that was horendous.</p>
